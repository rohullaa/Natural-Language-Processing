# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains my work in this course at UiO. This course is about modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) with main emphasis on probabilistic and 
machine learning techniques. The course includes an overview over typical NLP applications, like information extraction, machine translation, question-answering 
systems, and a more in-depth study of one such application.
